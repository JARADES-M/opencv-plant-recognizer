3 Parts--
  1: extracting the attributes
  2: characterizing object images
  3: matching scenes to object images

Extracting Attributes--
  1: segmentation (EM)
  2: retrieval of shape attributes (inner-distance shape context)

Characterizing Object Images--
  Just a set of attributes?

Matching Scenes to Object Images--
  1: allpairs distance from scene to object (perhaps no ML required)
